# Numerical-Computing-Coursework
The coursework is written in MATLAB. It mainly demonstrates 3 parts.

Part 1: Solving a nonlinear equation  
  This part contains 3 methods: bisection method, regular Falsi method and secant method
  
Part 2: Spline interpolation and least-squares approximation  
  This part shows the implementation of spline interpolation and least-squares approximation

Part 3: Numerical integration  
  This part shows the code of recursive trapezoid method and adaptive Simpson's method.
